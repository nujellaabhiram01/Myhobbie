<p>Playing Cricket is my hobby beacause it is a very good and interesting physical or outdoor game that is like an exercise and entertainment for everyone.It is a game with each team having at least 11 or in cricket we call it as XI of a team although many people don't follow this rule of having at least 11 players while playing the game.This is a game made for people who want to boost themselves up and get refreshed,Thus I like the game as it gives me a refreshing feeling when I am tired and makes me have a good sleep by making me wake up fresh at the next day's morning.This is something that is made for enthusiasts who are energetic and strong for hitting great sixes and boundaries.The cricketers also require great fitness for running,fielding and batting.This gmae also requires a lot of focus as we have to focus on the ball when hitting or catching the ball,for a great shot or a wicket.And last but not least this is the game which makes me happy when I am sad and changes my mood from angry or sad to good or happy.
